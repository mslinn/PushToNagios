# ENCRYPTION PASSWORD
# This is the password that should be used to encrypt the outgoing packets.  The NSCA daemon must use the same
# password when decrypting the packet!

#password=



# ENCRYPTION METHOD
# This option determines the method by which the send_nsca client will encrypt the packets it sends to the nsca daemon.
# Note: The encryption method you specify here must match the decryption method the nsca daemon uses (as specified in
# the nsca.cfg file).
# Values:
# 	0 = None
#   1 = Simple XOR  (No security, just obfuscation, but very fast)
# The following values are not supported by PushToNagios:
#   2 = DES
#   3 = 3DES (Triple DES)
#	4 = CAST-128
#	5 = CAST-256
#	6 = xTEA
#	7 = 3WAY
#	8 = BLOWFISH
#	9 = TWOFISH
#	10 = LOKI97
#	11 = RC2
#	12 = ARCFOUR
#
#	14 = RIJNDAEL-128
#	15 = RIJNDAEL-192
#	16 = RIJNDAEL-256
#
#	19 = WAKE
#	20 = SERPENT
#
#	22 = ENIGMA (Unix crypt)
#	23 = GOST
#	24 = SAFER64
